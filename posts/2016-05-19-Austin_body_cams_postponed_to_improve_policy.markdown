Today at City Hall, the City Council postponed the contract with Taser for police body cameras until its Public Safety Committee leads a process to improve the body camera policy that will guide officers. They gave that process a short timeline -- body cameras will be back on the June 9th agenda. But several members indicated serious concerns with the limitations of the policy that APD rolled out earlier this week. From transparency after a critical incident, to the protection of the privacy of children, Councilmembers found that the policy did not provide guideance particularly with respect to the rights of the public.

Tell your council member thank you!
