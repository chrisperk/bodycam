## Austin can do better

APD officers will soon be wearing video cameras. The city-wide conversation about how this should work is just getting started, but the [draft policy](http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Police/113016_highlights_body_worn_camera.pdf) released in Winter 2015 does not address these issues at all. Austin can require APD be both more transparent and more accountable by demanding the city follow broad principles like these:

- Transparency and accountability are  “law enforcement purposes”
- All critical incident video (officer involved death or injury) will be promptly released to the public;
- Each Austinite can decide for ourselves if a video involving us should be public or not
- The video material held by APD should not be used for general surveillance or aggregated with other data
