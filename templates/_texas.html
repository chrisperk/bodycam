<h3 id="the-good-">The good:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A grant program has encouraged widespread adoption of body cameras, including here.</li>
<li>Civilians who file a complaint against an officer will be able to view the video at some point.</li>
<li>Departments must keep the video for at least 90 days. Cities can have local policies that improve on the state framework.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-bad-">The bad:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Officers, but not civilians, will be allowed to review the video of an incident before making a statement.</li>
<li>Cities can refuse to release video of major incidents to the public, just like Chicago, unless the local policy says otherwise. - Video could be recording when an officer walks into your home.</li>
</ul>
