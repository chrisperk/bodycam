    <h3>What are body worn cameras?</h3>
    <h2>"On-officer recording systems" (also called "body cams" or "cop cams") are small, pager-sized cameras that clip on to an officer's uniform or are worn as a headset, and record audio and video of the officer's interactions with the public. Recent surveys suggest that about 25% of the nationâ€™s 17,000 police agencies were using them, with fully 80% of agencies evaluating the technology.</h2>
