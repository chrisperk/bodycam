<p>Police officers already collect basic information at traffic stops for the court and for required state reporting. Officers could briefly disclose that the encounter was taped and ask the driver if they wish to allow the video to be released to the public. This yes/no choice would be retained as metadata with the video file along with the other standard information.</p>

<p>The city still must decide what officers will do in private homes. Where video is taken but no one is being arrested, officers can offer civilians a choice to opt for public disclosure or not, just as they can do at traffic stops. But in many cases, it may be inappropriate for officers to be taping in your home and they should ask for your consent in advance. Meanwhile, it may be inappropriate for you to decide what is taped if you are being arrested for a crime. SWAT invasions should all be taped.</p>

<p>Officers walking along 6th street, surrounding a protest at the Capitol, or infiltrating the Republic of Texas biker rally may have their cameras on all the time or nearly all the time. Last summer, Chief Acevedo announced to the bikers, &quot;We will be staffed up to 100 percent and we will have undercover officers in crowds and will have eyes and ears in places people won&#39;t see us.&quot; This summer those officers may be taping. Should such video be uploaded to federal and state databases, crossed with facial recognition software and added to the surveillance apparatus? Thatâ€™s a debate Austin should have before someone else decides.</p>
