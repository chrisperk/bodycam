## The Vendors: Taser International

### Who is making money off all this?

There are only a handful of companies that provide body camera technology and services. Austin Police Department has picked [Taser International](https://www.taser.com/), a police and military contractor, as its vendor.

Taser has a great business model. It sells weapons for which you have to buy cartridges, like you do for your home printer. And it sells cameras, then offers data storage services (called Evidence.com). Sometimes it will entice cities with below cost cameras in order to secure that long term data storage contract.

> “Evidence.com, Axon cameras and related accessories are sometimes sold separately, but in most instances are sold together. In these instances, customers typically purchase and pay for the equipment and one year of Evidence.com in advance. Additional years of service are generally billed annually over a specified service term, which has typically ranged from one to five years. At times the Company subsidizes the cost of Axon devices provided to customers to secure long-term Evidence.com service contracts.
