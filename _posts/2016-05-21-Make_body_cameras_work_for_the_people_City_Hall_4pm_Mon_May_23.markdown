Come to Council, Monday, May 23 4pm: Help make body cameras work for the people! The Public Safety Committee of City Council on Monday will meet to hear what the public has to say about the use of police body cameras.

The [policy, just released by APD](http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Police/BWC_Policy.pdf), does require the cameras to be turned on during most interactions with the public. 

BUT 
-	it **gives individual officers a great deal of discretion** to decide when to turn them off to address privacy concerns;
-	it **does not require officers to explain why they are turning off the video** right there on the video before turning it off, although that would be simpler and more easily verified than writing an explanation in a report later;
-	it **does not address how video will be made available to the public**, and actually prohibits copies being given to people who file complaints against officers;
-	it **does not require officers to notify** people they are being video taped;
-	it **does not provide** a process **for people to elect to make** traffic-stop related **video taken of themselves public** (something the statute specifically allows for.)
-	it **does not say how body cameras will be used in 1st Amendment protected activities** and the relationship between this data and surveillance technologies available to law enforcement like facial recognition;
-	it **does not create a framework for** the equitable **disclosure** of all video after a critical incident (shooting, tasing, use of force).

[Read the policy here](http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Police/BWC_Policy.pdf), but don't get mad. Get serious.

We have a great opportunity on Monday. The [Council members on this committee](http://www.austintexas.gov/department/public-safety-committee) can direct APD to produce a better policy before the Council comes back in June to approve the contract to buy cameras. These members have already shown an interest in the public's views on many of these specific issues. See the public comment and member discussion from [last Thursday's Council meeting here (Item 30/31)](http://austintx.swagit.com/play/05192016-584/0/). 

**Come and speak from the heart. Come and speak to the issue that most concerns you. But please, come and speak.**
