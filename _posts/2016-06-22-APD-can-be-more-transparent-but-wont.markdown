Community groups report modest progress as Council reconsiders Taser contract for the third time.

UPDATE--<strong>City Council will reach this item early to mid-afternoon. If you wish to speak or donate your time so activists can have more than three minutes, come on down!</strong>

Taser's 12 million dollar contract for police body cameras comes back to Council tomorrow. After Council pointedly directed APD to negotiate with community groups about release of critical incident and other video, the groups had [this to say.](http://www.atxbodycam.com/documents/Community_release_APD_body_cam_062216.pdf)

After Councilmembers raised a number of questions about the contract, APD provided an initial set of proposed changes to the body camera policy [(item 17b)](http://austin.siretechnologies.com/sirepub/mtgviewer.aspx?meetid=1208&doctype=AGENDA) that are responsive to some community concerns.

But neither APD nor city legal demonstrated an inclination towards greater transparency.

In addition to the vote on the Taser contract, Council has scheduled an executive session on access to public information. City legal will likely have a lot to say, and council won't be hearing competing views during that session.

<strong>That's why its so important that people come on down to City Hall and participate in the discussion.</strong>

If you can't come to Council tomorrow evening, please [email your council members](https://www.austintexas.gov/email/all-council-members) to demand that Austin release critical incident video to the public promptly and use redaction to protect privacy.

The body camera contract itself is item 57 on a lengthy agenda, so if you are coming, plan to be there late.
