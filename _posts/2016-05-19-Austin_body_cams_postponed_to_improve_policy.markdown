Today at City Hall, the City Council postponed a vote on whether to approval the [proposed contract with Taser International](/documents/TASER_APD_051916_2.PDF) for police body cameras until its [Public Safety Committee](http://www.austintexas.gov/department/public-safety-committee) leads a process to improve the body camera policy that will give police officers more guidance. Council gave that process a short timeline -- body cameras will be back on the June 9th Council agenda. But several councilmembers indicated serious concerns with the limitations of the [policy that APD rolled out earlier this week](http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Police/BWC_Policy.pdf). From transparency after a critical incident, to the protection of the privacy of children, Councilmembers found that the policy did not provide guideance particularly with respect to the rights of the public.

[Tell your council member thank you!](http://www.austintexas.gov/government)
