We don't have a lot of information yet. The Statesman coverage is [scant at best.](http://www.mystatesman.com/news/news/local-govt-politics/court-orders-austin-to-place-police-body-camera-co/nrzzs/)

We will post a copy of the lawsuit as soon as we can get our hands on it. 

UPDATE 07/21/2016: In the meantime, [this Austin Chron article](http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2016-07-22/did-the-city-jump-into-bed-with-taser-too-fast/ ) has a lot more detail about why the lawsuit might succeed. More to come.
