title:  City Council postpones Taser Body Camera contract, wants disclosure

UPDATE: City Council tonight directed APD to <b>conduct a full public process on the body camera policy</b>, and then postponed again the vote to purchase cameras until APD conducts a real discussion about video release with community groups.

Community groups and APD are expected to meet again specifically to discuss transparency, public records and disclosure before the next vote.

Meanwhile, Debbie Russell, long time Austin police accountability activist shook up the room when she presented Council with a comparison of the cost of Austin's proposed Taser contract to the cost other cities have paid.

According to Russell, Austin is looking at one of the nation's most expensive Taser contracts -- at more than $12 million for 1700 cameras. A representative from Taser responded by saying Austin's contract actually provided for 2200 cameras. When Council members asked questions about that, Council learned that Austin only has about 1900 officers on the force.

Several Council members made it clear that they wanted staff to give them a great deal more detail about the financial committment they were making before June 23rd when the Taser deal is now scheduled to return to Council's agenda.

This postponement will be a victory for the public as long as APD takes it seriously and comes to the next dialog prepared to be more transparent in the future than they have been in the past.

Thanks to everyone who called or emailed Council! Several council members referenced the citizen messages they've been getting. Your voices are making this negotiation possible.
