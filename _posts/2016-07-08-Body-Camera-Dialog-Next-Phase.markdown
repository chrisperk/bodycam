On June 23rd the [Austin City Council voted to move ahead with a $12 million contract with Taser International (the  makers of Tasers) for body cameras.](http://www.austintexas.gov/department/city-council/2016/20160623-reg.htm)

Prior to that vote, community groups enjoyed considerable leverage to get some compromise out of the Austin Police Department negotiators in the ongoing discussion about shortcomings in APD's body camera policy. But after two postponements to allow for two serious negotiation sessions, Council decided to move forward. 

Some progress has been made. APD appears ready to specify situations where cameras should not be used (surveillance of first amendment protected activities) and situations where cameras can be turned off to protect privacy of witnesses and victims. APD appears prepared to notify the public that we are being videotaped. And APD has agreed that police accountability is a purpose for the program (it was originally just about collecting criminal case evidence.) But we've made no progress yet over public or family access to video footage after a critical incident. 

Now, with the camera program moving forward, a much broader community needs to join the negotiation process.

We expect to continue to make progress on transparency. City Council, and then the Public Safety Commission, have both passed resolutions making APD continue negotiations with the community. City Council members made it clear from the dias that they expect APD to move in a direction of transparency. 

Body camera video should be a way to establish the truth about incidents and build trust between officers and those they serve. That can't happen if only officers and never family members or the public get to see the video. APD started from the position that it was illegal to release any video. We've moved them to the position that it is actually legal, but they just don't want to. That's progress. 

The offical negotiation period runs through October and then APD and community groups will return to Council to report on the progress of these negotiations. It is likely that contract negotiation and then initial installation of cameras and equipment will take a couple of months, so these processes should run side by side. As APD gets the technology up and running, community groups can complete the policy making process. Ideal? No. Clearly the policy should have been in place to guide the technology choices and implementation. But we can work within this framework as long as we get strong participation from a range of interested parties.

Thus far, the leading groups have been the Austin Justice Coalition, Texans for Accountable Government, Texas Criminal Justice Coalition, EFF-Austin, and the ACLU. We need more groups to help us so that our voice is strong, clear and reflects the views of a broad community coalition.

If your organization can start sending a volunteer or staff person to participate in the ongoing dialog with APD, please contact Kathy Mitchell at mitckagardener@yahoo.com. Even if you have time only to sign on to the position statements that the existing coalition creates, that's helpful.
