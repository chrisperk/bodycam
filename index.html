<p><h2>What are body worn cameras?</h2></p>
<p>&quot;On-officer recording systems&quot; (also called &quot;body cams&quot; or &quot;cop cams&quot;) are small, pager-sized cameras that clip on to an officer&#39;s uniform or are worn as a headset, and record audio and video of the officer&#39;s interactions with the public. Recent surveys suggest that about 25% of the nation’s 17,000 police agencies were using them, with fully 80% of agencies evaluating the technology.</p>

			<h2 id="why-should-we-care-about-police-with-body-cameras-">Why should we care about police with body cameras?</h2>
<p>Body cameras don’t necessarily change how police or civilians behave, but they can show us how we all behave, and sometimes we behave badly. If body camera video is always released to the public, we can have a reasonable debate about the next step – the path to better police/community relations. But if police can decide to release some videos but not others, the community will believe the police are protecting their own at the expense of community safety and respect.</p>

			<h2 id="-button-the-good-">[button] The good:</h2>
<p>A grant program has encouraged widespread adoption of body cameras, including here. Civilians who file a complaint against an officer will be able to view the video at some point. Departments must keep the video for at least 90 days. Cities can have local policies that improve on the state framework.</p>
<h2 id="-button-the-bad-">[button] The bad:</h2>
<p>Officers, but not civilians, will be allowed to review the video of an incident before making a statement. Cities can refuse to release video of major incidents to the public, just like Chicago, unless the local policy says otherwise. Video could be recording when an officer walks into your home.</p>

			<h1 id="austin-can-do-better">Austin can do better</h1>
<p>APD officers will soon be wearing video cameras. The city-wide conversation about how this should work is just getting started, but the draft policy released last winter [<a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Police/113016_highlights_body_worn_camera.pdf">http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Police/113016_highlights_body_worn_camera.pdf</a>] does not address these issues at all. Austin can require APD be both more transparent and more accountable by demanding the city follow broad principles like these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transparency and accountability are  “law enforcement purposes”</li>
<li>All critical incident video (officer involved death or injury) will be promptly released to the public;</li>
<li>Each Austinite can decide for ourselves if a video involving us should be public or not</li>
<li>The video material held by APD should not be used for general surveillance or aggregated with other data  </li>
</ul>

			<h1 id="austin-can-balance-privacy-and-accountability">Austin can balance privacy and accountability</h1>
<h2 id="privacy-button-">Privacy [button]</h2>
<p>Austin can give people control over our privacy by requiring, at the end of an ordinary interaction (traffic stop, street encounter), that officers tell us that we have been taped and ask if we wish to opt-in to public release. Opt-in/Opt-out choices are a familiar way to facilitate the level of privacy different people prefer.
Under &quot;Transparency&quot; this text: Austin can decide that transparency and accountability are integral to effective law enforcement and that the city will promptly release audio and video of all critical incidents (shootings, injuries). The city can facilitate release all video where a person has opted-in by posting the file to an open site with all the state-law required information.</p>
<h2 id="transparency-button-">Transparency [button]</h2>
<p>[Then maybe can we have three icons you can click, side by side maybe with a headline?]</p>
<h3 id="how-would-an-opt-in-program-work-">How would an Opt-in Program work?</h3>
<h4 id="roadside-stop-button-">Roadside stop [button]</h4>
<p>Police officers already collect basic information at traffic stops for the court and for required state reporting. Officers could briefly disclose that the encounter was taped and ask the driver if they wish to allow the video to be released to the public. This yes/no choice would be retained as metadata with the video file along with the other standard information.</p>
<h4 id="in-your-home-button-">In your home [button]</h4>
<p>The city still must decide what officers will do in private homes. Where video is taken but no one is being arrested, officers can offer civilians a choice to opt for public disclosure or not, just as they can do at traffic stops. But in many cases, it may be inappropriate for officers to be taping in your home and they should ask for your consent in advance. Meanwhile, it may be inappropriate for you to decide what is taped if you are being arrested for a crime. SWAT invasions should all be taped.</p>
<h4 id="on-the-street-button-">On the street [button]</h4>
<p>Officers walking along 6th street, surrounding a protest at the Capitol, or infiltrating the Republic of Texas biker rally may have their cameras on all the time or nearly all the time. Last summer, Chief Acevedo announced to the bikers, &quot;We will be staffed up to 100 percent and we will have undercover officers in crowds and will have eyes and ears in places people won&#39;t see us.&quot; This summer those officers may be taping. Should such video be uploaded to federal and state databases, crossed with facial recognition software and added to the surveillance apparatus? That’s a debate Austin should have before someone else decides.</p>

			<h1 id="the-vendors-taser-international">The Vendors: Taser International</h1>
<p>Who is making money off all this (always a good thing to ask): Taser International [<a href="https://www.taser.com/">https://www.taser.com/</a>]. There are only a handful of companies that provide body camera technology and services. Austin has picked Taser, a big police and military contractor, as its vendor. Taser’s recent growth, as reported in its March 2016 financial report [<a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1069183/000106918316000148/a10ktasr123115.htm">http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1069183/000106918316000148/a10ktasr123115.htm</a>] has been largely driven by its police body camera offerings (weapons segment growth, 12%; camera segment growth, 88%.)</p>
<p>Taser has a great business model. It sells weapons for which you have to buy cartridges, like you do for your home printer. And it sells cameras, then offers data storage services [its “Evidence.com” product.] Sometimes it will just give away the cameras in order to secure that long term data storage contract.
[can we have a pull quote? From their 10k filed with the SEC: “Evidence.com, Axon cameras and related accessories are sometimes sold separately, but in most instances are sold together. In these instances, customers typically purchase and pay for the equipment and one year of Evidence.com in advance. Additional years of service are generally billed annually over a specified service term, which has typically ranged from one to five years. Axon equipment represents a deliverable that is provided to the customer at the time of sale, while Evidence.com services are provided over the specified term of the contract…At times the Company subsidizes the cost of Axon devices provided to customers to secure long-term Evidence.com service contracts.]
APD has not yet released the new Taser contract. We will post it here as soon as we get it.</p>
